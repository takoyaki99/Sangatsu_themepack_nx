# Sangatsu_themepack_nx
This is the github release of a theme that I made! It's inspired by the album cover of Sangatsu no Phantasia's album Blue Pop Reverbation. 
This is in beta, I still need to (maybe) change things to support the diamond layout better, and to make the theme more compatible with either light/dark mode.
